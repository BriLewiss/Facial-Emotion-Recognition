# Emotional-Monitoring
This repository contains code for a Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) system implemented using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The FER system is designed to recognize four emotions: anger, happy, sad, and neutral. The code utilizes the Keras library with a TensorFlow backend for building and training the CNN model.
